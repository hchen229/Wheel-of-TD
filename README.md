## Game Logic
It's like wheel of forture, instead of getting a prize you get to do an fun action or tell a truth

## Created score display
-to determine the winner 
-score is based player's execution 

## Created iteration animation
-have to stop randomly

## Created two decks of flipping card
-one deck consist of all of the truth questions
-other deck is all dare actions
